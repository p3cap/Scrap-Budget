With this tool you can compete without having to banish items like thusrters, because you can now just lower a thurest will probobly cost their whole creation.

## !!THIS TOOL IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS IT'S NOT COMPLETED!!

INSTRUCTIONS:
When you start the Main.py named file, click open and select the blueprint you want to check.
To select an existing blueprint go to %AppData%\Roaming\Axolot Games\Scrap Mechanic\User\User_<userID here>\Blueprints
If you arrange them by date modified the top folder will be your last blueprint.

you may ask why I didn't create a mode instead. And my answer is that I'm working on it... It's harder than it seems...
